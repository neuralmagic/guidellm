**GuideLLM** is a powerful tool for evaluating and optimizing the deployment of large language models (LLMs). By simulating real-world inference workloads, GuideLLM helps users gauge the performance, resource needs, and cost implications of deploying LLMs on various hardware configurations. This ensures efficient, scalable, and cost-effective LLM inference serving while maintaining high service quality.

### Key Features

- **Performance Evaluation:** Analyze LLM inference under different load scenarios to ensure your system meets your service level objectives (SLOs).
- **Resource Optimization:** Determine the most suitable hardware configurations for running your models effectively.
- **Cost Estimation:** Understand the financial impact of different deployment strategies and make informed decisions to minimize costs.
- **Scalability Testing:** Simulate scaling to handle large numbers of concurrent users without degradation in performance.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before installing, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- OS: Linux or MacOS
- Python: 3.8 â€“ 3.12

GuideLLM is available on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`:

```bash
pip install guidellm
```

For detailed installation instructions and requirements, see the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/neuralmagic/guidellm/tree/main/docs/install.md).

### Quick Start

#### 1. Start an OpenAI Compatible Server (vLLM)

GuideLLM requires an OpenAI-compatible server to run evaluations. It's recommended that [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) be used for this purpose. To start a vLLM server with a Llama 3.1 8B quantized model, run the following command:

```bash
vllm serve "neuralmagic/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w4a16"
```

For more information on starting a vLLM server, see the [vLLM Documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html).

#### 2. Run a GuideLLM Evaluation

To run a GuideLLM evaluation, use the `guidellm` command with the appropriate model name and options on the server hosting the model or one with network access to the deployment server. For example, to evaluate the full performance range of the previously deployed Llama 3.1 8B model, run the following command:

```bash
guidellm \
  --target "http://localhost:8000/v1" \
  --model "neuralmagic/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-quantized.w4a16" \
  --data-type emulated \
  --data "prompt_tokens=512,generated_tokens=128"
```

The above command will begin the evaluation and output progress updates similar to the following (if running on a different server, be sure to update the target!): <img src="https://github.com/neuralmagic/guidellm/blob/main/docs/assets/sample-benchmark.gif" />

Notes:

- The `--target` flag specifies the server hosting the model. In this case, it is a local vLLM server.
- The `--model` flag specifies the model to evaluate. The model name should match the name of the model deployed on the server
- By default, GuideLLM will run a `sweep` of performance evaluations across different request rates, each lasting 120 seconds. The results will be saved to a local directory.

#### 3. Analyze the Results

After the evaluation is completed, GuideLLM will output a summary of the results, including various performance metrics. The results will also be saved to a local directory for further analysis.

The output results will start with a summary of the evaluation, followed by the requests data for each benchmark run. For example, the start of the output will look like the following:

<img alt="Sample GuideLLM benchmark start output" src="https://github.com/neuralmagic/guidellm/blob/main/docs/assets/sample-output-start.png" />

The end of the output will include important performance summary metrics such as request latency, time to first token (TTFT), inter-token latency (ITL), and more:

### Configurations

GuideLLM provides various CLI and environment options to customize evaluations, including setting the duration of each benchmark run, the number of concurrent requests, and the request rate.

Some common configurations for the CLI include:

- `--rate-type`: The rate to use for benchmarking. Options include `sweep`, `synchronous`, `throughput`, `constant`, and `poisson`.
  - `--rate-type sweep`: (default) Sweep runs through the full range of performance for the server. Starting with a `synchronous` rate first, then `throughput`, and finally 10 `constant` rates between the min and max request rate found.
  - `--rate-type synchronous`: Synchronous runs requests in a synchronous manner, one after the other.
  - `--rate-type throughput`: Throughput runs requests in a throughput manner, sending requests as fast as possible.
  - `--rate-type constant`: Constant runs requests at a constant rate. Specify the rate in requests per second with the `--rate` argument. For example, `--rate 10` or multiple rates with `--rate 10 --rate 20 --rate 30`.
  - `--rate-type poisson`: Poisson draws from a poisson distribution with the mean at the specified rate, adding some real-world variance to the runs. Specify the rate in requests per second with the `--rate` argument. For example, `--rate 10` or multiple rates with `--rate 10 --rate 20 --rate 30`.
- `--data-type`: The data to use for the benchmark. Options include `emulated`, `transformers`, and `file`.
  - `--data-type emulated`: Emulated supports an EmulationConfig in string or file format for the `--data` argument to generate fake data. Specify the number of prompt tokens at a minimum and optionally the number of output tokens and other params for variance in the length. For example, `--data "prompt_tokens=128"`, `--data "prompt_tokens=128,generated_tokens=128"`, or `--data "prompt_tokens=128,prompt_tokens_variance=10"`.
  - `--data-type file`: File supports a file path or URL to a file for the `--data` argument. The file should contain data encoded as a CSV, JSONL, TXT, or JSON/YAML file with a single prompt per line for CSV, JSONL, and TXT or a list of prompts for JSON/YAML. For example, `--data "data.txt"` where data.txt contents are `"prompt1\nprompt2\nprompt3"`.
  - `--data-type transformers`: Transformers supports a dataset name or dataset file path for the `--data` argument. For example, `--data "neuralmagic/LLM_compression_calibration"`.
- `--max-seconds`: The maximum number of seconds to run each benchmark. The default is 120 seconds.
- `--max-requests`: The maximum number of requests to run in each benchmark.

For a full list of supported CLI arguments, run the following command:

```bash
guidellm --help
```

For a full list of configuration options, run the following command:

```bash
guidellm-config
```
