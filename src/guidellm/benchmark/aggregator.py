Benchmark result aggregation and compilation interfaces.

Provides protocols and implementations for collecting, processing, and compiling
benchmark data from scheduler executions into final metrics and statistics.

Classes:
    Aggregator: Protocol for processing benchmark data updates.
    CompilableAggregator: Protocol for aggregators that can compile final results.
    SchedulerStatsAggregator: Aggregates scheduler timing and performance metrics.
    GenerativeRequestsStatsProgressAggregator: Tracks generation metrics during run.
    GenerativeRequestsAggregator: Compiles complete generative benchmark results.

Functions:
    add_aggregate_metric: Helper for accumulating timing and count metrics.

Type Variables:
    RequestT: Generic request object type.
    ResponseT: Generic response object type.
    RequestTimingsT: Generic request timing object type.
