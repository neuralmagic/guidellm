"""
Singleton pattern implementations for ensuring single instance classes.

Provides singleton mixins for creating classes that maintain a single instance
throughout the application lifecycle, with support for both basic and thread-safe
implementations. These mixins integrate with the scheduler and other system components
to ensure consistent state management and prevent duplicate resource allocation.

class SingletonMixin:

    Basic singleton mixin ensuring single instance per class.

    Implements the singleton pattern using class variables to control instance
    creation. Subclasses must call super().__init__() for proper initialization
    state management. Suitable for single-threaded environments or when external
    synchronization is provided.

    Example:
    ::
        class ConfigManager(SingletonMixin):
            def __init__(self, config_path: str):
                super().__init__()

        manager2 = ConfigManager("config.json")
