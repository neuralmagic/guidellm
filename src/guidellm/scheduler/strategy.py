"""
Request scheduling strategies for the GuideLLM toolkit.

This module provides a comprehensive set of scheduling strategies that control how
requests are processed and timed within the GuideLLM benchmarking system. These
strategies enable fine-grained control over request concurrency, timing patterns,
and throughput characteristics to simulate various real-world usage scenarios.

The scheduling system is built around abstract timing implementations that define
when requests should be executed, and concrete strategy classes that combine
timing behaviors with process and concurrency limits.

Classes:
    ScheduledRequestTimings: Abstract base class for request timing implementations
    LastCompletionRequestTimings: Timing implementation for synchronous/concurrent
        strategies
    NoDelayRequestTimings: Timing implementation for throughput-maximizing strategies
    ConstantRateRequestTimings: Timing implementation for constant-rate request
        scheduling
    PoissonRateRequestTimings: Timing implementation for Poisson-distributed request
        scheduling
    SchedulingStrategy: Abstract base class for all scheduling strategies
    SynchronousStrategy: Sequential request processing with maximum throughput
    ConcurrentStrategy: Parallel request processing with limited concurrency
    ThroughputStrategy: Unrestricted request processing for maximum system throughput
    AsyncConstantStrategy: Asynchronous request scheduling at a constant rate
    AsyncPoissonStrategy: Asynchronous request scheduling with Poisson distribution
