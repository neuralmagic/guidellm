# Developer Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the developer documentation for `guidellm`, a guidance platform for evaluating large language model deployments.
This document aims to provide developers with all the necessary information to contribute to the project effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- `git` (version control system)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neuralmagic/guidellm.git
   cd guidellm
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Python project structure:

```plaintext
guidellm/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ guidellm/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ unit/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ e2e/
â”œâ”€â”€ pyproject.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ tox.ini
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **src/guidellm/**: Main source code for the project.
- **tests/**: Test cases categorized into unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

## Development Environment Setup

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. Install pre-commit hooks:

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

## Code Quality and Style Guidelines

We use several tools to maintain code quality and consistency:

### Ruff

Ruff is used for linting and formatting checks.

- Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.
- To run Ruff:
  ```bash
  ruff check src tests
  ```

### Isort

Isort is used for sorting imports.

- Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.
- To sort imports:
  ```bash
  isort src tests
  ```

### Flake8

Flake8 is used for linting.

- Configuration is in `tox.ini`.
- To run Flake8:
  ```bash
  flake8 src tests --max-line-length 88
  ```

### MyPy

MyPy is used for type checking.

- Configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.
- To run MyPy:
  ```bash
  mypy src/guidellm
  ```

## Testing

We use `pytest` for running tests.

### Running All Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
tox
```

Additionally, all tests are marked with smoke, sanity, or regression tags for better organization.
To run tests with a specific tag, use the `-m` flag:

```bash
tox -- -m "smoke or sanity"
```

### Running Unit Tests

The unit tests are located in the `tests/unit` directory.
To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
tox -e test-unit
```

### Running Integration Tests

The integration tests are located in the `tests/integration` directory.
To run the integration tests, use the following command:

```bash
tox -e test-integration
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

The end-to-end tests are located in the `tests/e2e` directory.
To run the end-to-end tests, use the following command:

```bash
tox -e test-e2e
```

## Formatting, Linting, and Type Checking

### Running Quality Checks (Linting)

To run quality checks (ruff, isort, flake8, mypy), use the following command:

```bash
tox -e quality
```

### Running Auto Formatting and Validation

To run formatting checks and fixes (ruff, isort, flake8) for automatic formatting, use the following command:

```bash
tox -e style
```

### Type Checking

To run type checks (MyPy), use the following command:

```bash
tox -e types
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, use the following command:

```bash
tox -e build
```

## Cleaning Up

To clean up build, dist, and cache files, use the following command:

```bash
tox -e clean
```

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Our CI/CD pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions.
The configuration files are located in the .github/workflows/ directory.
You can run the CI/CD pipeline locally using act or similar tools.

## Contributing

Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute to the project.

## Maintaining

Please refer to the MAINTAINERS file for maintenance guidelines and contact information.

## Project configuration

The project configuartion is powered by _[`ðŸ”— pydantic-settings`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/pydantic_settings/)_

The project configuration entry point is represented by lazy-loaded `settigns` singleton object ( `src/config/__init__` )

The project is fully configurable with environment variables. All the default values and

```py
class NestedIntoLogging(BaseModel):
    nested: str = "default value"

class LoggingSettings(BaseModel):
    # ...
    disabled: bool = False


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    """The entrypoint to settings."""

    # ...
    logging: LoggingSettings = LoggingSettings()


settings = Settings()
```

With that configuration set you can load parameters to `LoggingSettings()` by using environment variables. Just run `export GUIDELLM__LOGGING__DISABLED=true` or `export GUIDELLM__LOGGING__NESTED=another_value` respectfully. The nesting delimiter is `__`
